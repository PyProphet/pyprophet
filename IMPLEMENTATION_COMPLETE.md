# Implementation Summary: Gain-Like Metric for Permutation Importance

## Overview

This implementation ensures that `HistGBCLearner` (HistGradientBoostingClassifier) uses a **gain-like permutation importance scorer** that aligns with XGBoost's default "gain" metric for measuring feature importance.

## Problem

The previous implementation had a conditional that would use scikit-learn's native `feature_importances_` attribute when available. However, this attribute uses a **split-based** importance metric (counting feature usage frequency), not a **gain-based** metric (measuring loss reduction). This made feature importances inconsistent between XGBoost and HistGradientBoosting.

## Solution

Modified `HistGBCLearner.learn()` to **always** compute permutation importance using a custom gain-like scorer, regardless of whether sklearn provides native feature importances.

### Key Changes

1. **Removed Conditional** (pyprophet/scoring/classifiers.py, lines 406-455)
   - Previously: `if hasattr(classifier, "feature_importances_")` would use native importances
   - Now: Always computes gain-like permutation importance

2. **Gain-Like Scorer** (lines 430-435)
   ```python
   def loss_gain_score(y_true, y_pred_proba, **kwargs):
       """Score based on negative log loss - higher is better, like XGBoost gain."""
       return -log_loss(y_true, y_pred_proba, labels=[0, 1])
   
   gain_scorer = make_scorer(loss_gain_score, greater_is_better=True, needs_proba=True)
   ```

3. **Implementation Details**
   - Uses stratified subsampling (up to 2000 samples) for speed
   - Computes permutation importance with 5 repeats
   - Clamps negative values to zero
   - Scales by 100x to match XGBoost's gain magnitude
   - Stores in XGBoost-compatible format: `{'f0': val, 'f1': val, ...}`

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation

  - `test_histgbc_scorer_produces_reasonable_scores()` - Tests rankings
  - `test_histgbc_importance_stored_on_classifier()` - Tests persistence
  - `test_histgbc_importance_format_matches_xgboost()` - Tests compatibility

### Documentation
- **GAIN_SCORER_IMPLEMENTATION.md** (NEW)
  - Detailed technical documentation
  - Implementation rationale
  - Performance considerations
  - Comparison with XGBoost

### Examples
- **examples/gain_scorer_demo.py** (NEW)
  - Demonstrates gain-like scorer usage
  - Compares HistGBC vs XGBoost importances
  - Shows feature ranking comparison

## Testing

To run the tests:
```bash
pytest tests/test_gain_scorer.py -v
```

To run the demo:
```bash
python examples/gain_scorer_demo.py
```

To compare classifiers on real data:
```bash
python compare_classifiers.py --in test_data.osw --level ms2
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Feature importances now align with XGBoost's gain metric
2. **Interpretability**: Measures actual contribution to model performance
3. **Sensitivity**: More sensitive to feature impact than split-based importance
4. **Compatibility**: Same format and scale as XGBoost for easy comparison

## Technical Details

### Why Negative Log Loss?

Permutation importance measures the **drop in performance** when a feature is shuffled. By using negative log loss as the scoring function:
- Baseline score = -log_loss(y, predictions)
- After shuffling feature i = -log_loss(y, predictions_with_shuffled_i)
- Importance = baseline - shuffled = how much performance drops

This directly measures how much each feature reduces the loss function, which is exactly what XGBoost's "gain" metric represents.

### Performance Optimization

- **Subsampling**: Limited to 2000 samples for computational efficiency
- **Stratification**: Maintains class balance in subsample
- **Parallelization**: Uses all CPU cores (`n_jobs=-1`)
- **Caching**: Stores importances on classifier for persistence

### Scaling Factor

The 100x scaling factor matches the typical range of XGBoost's gain values (0-100+), making visual comparisons more intuitive.

## Validation

The implementation has been validated to:
- ✅ Compute non-negative importances for all features
- ✅ Use XGBoost-compatible format (`f0`, `f1`, etc.)
- ✅ Persist through serialization/deserialization
- ✅ Produce meaningful feature rankings
- ✅ Work with the existing pyprophet infrastructure

## Future Work

Potential enhancements:
1. Make `n_repeats` configurable via parameters
2. Add option to use alternative scoring metrics
3. Support feature interaction importance
4. Add importance caching for faster re-use
5. Benchmark computation time vs accuracy trade-offs
